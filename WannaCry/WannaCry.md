- 07c44729e2c570b37db695323249474831f5861d45318bf49ccf5d2f5c8ea1cd.exe (WannaCry)
- Tasksche.exe (Dropped by WannaCry)
- WCRY.XIA (zip file containing file dropped by Tasksche.exe)
- WCRY (Folder containing other dropped files by Tasksche.exe)

## Behavior
This may seem a little strange, but this WannaCry version, does open a site request, but does not actually stops itself if it finds the site, and continues anyways. In other versions, the site request behave like a killswitch, that stops the malware from spreading and running.

Anyways, after this first function, the malware creates a service with the name of "mssecsvc2.0", with descryption "Microsoft_Security_Center_(2.0)", and marks it to execute with "-m security" arguments.
After that, he drops the tasksche.exe file from the resource no. 1831, and it puts it in the "C:\Windows\qeriuwjhrf" folder.

At this point, when the WannaCry re-execute itself with the arguments, it executes tasksche.exe.
