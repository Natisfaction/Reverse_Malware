# WannaCry
## Credits
Being first "real" reverse-engineered project, I didn't know really well how to do some things, I decided to look online, and I came across someone that was doing the same thing!

## Files
- .exe (WannaCry)
- Tasksche.exe (Dropped by WannaCry)
- wcry.XIA (zip file containing file dropped by Tasksche.exe)
- wcry (Folder containing other dropped files by Tasksche.exe)

## Behavior
...

Anyways, after this first function, the malware creates a service with the name of "mssecsvc2.0", with descryption "Microsoft_Security_Center_(2.0)", and marks it to execute with "-m security" arguments.
After that, he drops the tasksche.exe file from the resource no. 1831, and it puts it in the "C:\Windows\qeriuwjhrf" folder.

At this point, when the WannaCry re-execute itself with the arguments, it executes tasksche.exe.
