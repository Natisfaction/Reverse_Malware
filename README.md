# Reverse engineering some malware

## What is that!??
Welcome! I created this repository to learn how to reverse engineer malware, just for fun!

## Disclaimers
In this repository, all the reverse-engineered code will be provided with a .md file that describes the malware's behavior.
However, please note that I am a student and NOT an experienced reverse engineer, so there may be some incorrect code in this repository.

Also, I want to make it clear that this repository contains decompiled malware code, which could be used for malicious purposes. 
Therefore, I DO NOT encourage the usage of this code for any illegal activities.

## Setup
Currently, I am using Ghidra as my reverse engineering tool. You can find it at: https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra

## Credits
If you use any of my code in your project, please give credit to me.
