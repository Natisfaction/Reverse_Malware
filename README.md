# Reverse engineering some malware

## What is that!??
Welcome! I created this repository to learn how to reverse engineer, and I decided to use malwares to practice!

## Disclaimers
In this repository you will find actual malware code and reverse engineered code. Because of that, I must proclaim that YOU MUSN'T USE THE CODE FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES. I WON'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF YOUR ACTIONS, AND FOR ANY DAMAGE YOU MAY CREATE USING THE CODE. Also, do please note that I'm a student and NOT an experienced reverse engineer, so the provided code could be incorrect.

If you want to try those malware in a VM, please make sure that it's appropriately isolated. I'm using **Microsoft Windows XP x64 Professional Edition**, emulated via QEMU with UTM software.

## Credits
If you use some part of the code, or extract infomation from the markdown files (I don't however suggest to do that, because I may not have "interpreted" the code correctly, or maybe I interpreted the code wrong), please give me credit. I'd really appreciate it!!!
