# Reverse engineering some malware

## What is that!??
Welcome! I created this repository to learn how to reverse engineer, and I decided to use malwares to practice!

## Disclaimers
In this repository you will find actual malware code and reverse engineered code. Because of that, I must proclaim that YOU MUSN'T USE THE CODE FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES. I WON'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF YOUR ACTIONS, AND FOR ANY DAMAGE YOU MAY CREATE USING THE CODE. Also, do please note that I'm a student and NOT an experienced reverse engineer, so there will be some incorrect code in this repository.

If you want to test those malware (idk why you'd do that), remember to execute them in a VIRTUAL MACHINE, and SHUT DOWN YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION, and more in general, ISOLATE YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE from the rest.

## Credits
If you use some part of the code, or extract infomation from the markdown files (I don't however suggest to do that, because I may not have "read" the code correctly, or maybe I interpreted the code wrong), please give me credit. I'd really appreciate it!!!
