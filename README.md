# Reverse engineering some malware

## What is that!??
Welcome! I created this repository to learn how to reverse engineer, and I decided to use malwares!

## Disclaimers
In this repository, all the reverse-engineered code will be provided with a .md file that describes the malware's behavior.
However, please note that I'm a student and NOT an experienced reverse engineer, so there will be some incorrect code in this repository.

Also, I want to make it clear that this repository contains malware code, which could be used for malicious purposes. 
To make it clear, I DO NOT encourage the usage of this code for any illegal activities, and I won't be responsible for ANY kind of damage that you'll make by using those malwares, including to your own machine.

If you want to test those malware (idk why you'd do that), remember to execute them in a VIRTUAL MACHINE, and SHUT DOWN YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION, and more in general, ISOLATE YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE.

## What you'll find on this repository???
Inside of the root folder, there are some other folders, labeled as the malware. Inside of them there'll be the Ghidra project (if you want to check out the decompilation), the malware binaries, and a readme (where I'll document my research).

## Setup
Currently, as my reverse engineering tools I'm using:
-   [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) as my disassembler/decompiler;
-   [wrestool](https://www.nongnu.org/icoutils) to extract WannaCry's files.
